# concept-representation_fMRI
Analysis of fMRI and behavioural response data showing how neuroimaging provides a uniquely direct window into our thoughts (vs. behavioural cognitive science)

## Code description
Code snippets of clustering analyses (agglomerative k-means and hierarchical) revealing the semantic dimensions of our thoughts about natural concepts (animal concepts). fMRI provides a direct window into our thoughts and reveals that our thoughts of animals (and other concepts more generally) are less sophisticated than behavioural response data otherwise indicates. In the case of animal concepts, clustering analyses of fMRI data indicate that our thoughts of animals concern a small number of dimensions, e.g. an animal's habitat, ferocity, etc.
